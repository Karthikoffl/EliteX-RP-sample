            <h1>RP RULES</h1>
        </header>
    <article>
        <h2>Community Rules:</h2>
        <p>Read all the rules carefully. Claiming ignorance of these rules is not allowed and will result in at least a 24-hour ban
            •Be respectful of others in the community; personal insults or verbal attacks outside of role-play (RP) are strictly prohibited!
            •Any player caught harassing or bullying another player on the server, or outside of the server but in relation to their presence on the server, will be permanently removed and barred from the current and any future whitelists.
            •Your first action in any disagreement should always be to try to RP it out. If that does not work and you have a problem with another player, handle it privately, rather than having an open argument on the radio/in chat in the game or in a public forum like Discord or YouTube. If the player has broken a rule, file a OOC complaint.
            •Speaking poorly of others on streams, in chats, or elsewhere will not be tolerated. If you have an issue with someone, submit a report. You are representing EliteX RP when you are on our servers.
            •Do not message admins directly for general questions. We have Discord channels where you can ask for assistance. You MAY message admins for issues you would like kept private like giving personal info (email) or queries of a possible rule break where you worry the other party may see it in a general channel and attack you. To keep your anonymity, you may then DM an admin for help.
            
            •If an admin contacts you to discuss a rule break ticket, the ban will not be lifted (regardless of its initial duration) until you have spoken to the admin. If an admin contacts you to discuss a rule break and you do not acknowledge the message with a response, you may be deprived of PR until you do so.
            •When you applied to EliteXRP, you signed up with Discord as part of the process. It is required that you edit your nickname on the EliteXRP Discord server to “Steam Name You Applied With (Current Character Name)” so that it’s easier for people to contact you. Additionally, this will allow admins to find you quickly in the event a report is filed against you. If the admins are unable to contact you, we will have no other recourse than to take appropriate actions against you, as we will only have one side of the story. If your Steam name is the same as your character name, you must still follow this rule. No! or – or some dumb characters are allowed in your discord names until and unless your in-game character also is the same.
            •You must always stay in character on EliteXRP servers. This means no going out-of-character (OOC) on the radio/in-game chats, as well. Message people on Steam, Discord, or other methods if you need to, but keep it all in-character (IC) when playing on EliteXRP. </p>

        <h2>GENERAL RULES:</h2>
        <p>•Respect others always. Racism, hate speech, rape, and sexual harassment are not allowed.
            •Do not grief others. Grieving is the act of intentionally angering or irritating another player with malicious intent. Example: Consistently stalking a player to force RP.
            •No PD baiting. Value for your life/freedom and strive to not get caught in a crime. Jail/ Fines are not to be treated lightly.
            •Do not glitch any elements of the game or use exploits. (Will be banned at sight)
            •Vehicle repairs are not to be used from inside a car during any chase by either party, criminal or PD. You must be clear of any situation before starting repairs unless standing outside the vehicle.
            •You must never go into an apartment or green zones to avoid consequences and not into gang areas to avoid police scenarios.
            •PD Interaction guidelines are to be followed while interacting on the server. (ECPD RULES can be found in section in discord).
            •Your clothing must be changed at realistic locations (A closet, from the back of a car, clothing store) and must not be done to avoid immediate consequences. IE. Changing in the middle of a chase or when you have not gotten away fully is against the server rules. This includes the Usage of the ‘Y’ clothing menu. It must be used in proper places only.
            
            SERVER RESTARTS/CRASHES: You may not use a server restart or crash to gain advantage:
            o An example of using a restart to your advantage would be robbing Pacific standard straight after a restart, doing this will lead to a 24-hour ban minimum.
            o Furthermore, you must wait 20 minutes after a restart to begin any heist on the server.
            o You may not use a server restart or crash to escape an RP situation you were in before the restart/crash. You must wait for the other players to reconnect, and then continue the RP. This includes if you disconnect, you must find your way back to the RP situation (IE. In cuffs with the cops, being transported to a police station, if you were in a cell or if someone kidnapped you and the DC made you fall out of the car). You must try to return to the RP (Even if it means sending someone a discord DM to do so).</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>COMMUNICATION:</h2>
        <p>•MICROPHONES AND CHAT: A microphone is required to play on EliteXRP. If your mic breaks, find a reason your character is suddenly mute (a sore throat is a good reason to not log in!) and exit the situation as gracefully as you can.
            •External communication – The moment you begin active RP (conflict RP or story RP), you MUST mute or close your external VOIP connection (Includes Discord, Skype or whatever).</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>GREEN ZONES:</h2>
        <p>Green zones should be crime-free. It is Fail RP to run away from a crime and enter the green zone. If the RP begins outside of it and is brought into the green zone, you may continue the criminal RP, however, it must be realistic. An example, in which it is not allowed due to realism, would be bringing a gang vs gang fight to the Police Station or Hospital.

            • Spawn
            • Hospital
            • Clothing Stores
            • PD
            • Grinding Locations</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>NO POWER-GAMING:</h2>
        <p>Power-gaming: using in-game or RP mechanics without allowing other players the freedom to act or defend themselves. This includes forcing RP on others, so they are obligated to lose.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>NO META-GAMING:</h2>
        <p>Meta-gaming: the act of using out-of-character/external information for in-game situations. This includes stream sniping, 3rd party VOIP applications, etc.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>NO EXPLOITING OR HACKING:</h2>
        <p>This includes AFK farming, abusing in-game bugs, etc. This will result in an immediate ban.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>NO RDM & VDM:</h2>
        <p>RDM (Random Death Match) & VDM (Vehicle Death match) are prohibited against any player if verbal interactions have not occurred. Those who commit random acts of violence like this will be banned.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>NLR:</h2>
        <p>NLR (New-Life Rule): If your character is downed and has received injuries that cannot be saved, you will have no recollection of your death.
            If your character is in a situation in which they cannot survive, and no help can be given, you are expected to coma your character for as long as you choose.
            •Do not press “G”, aka the distress signal, or call EMS, if you cannot reach your phone. It is considered fail RP. You will have to re spawn unless there is someone else in the RP scenario that will be able to call an EMS.
            If you re spawn, you will completely lose all memory of the RP situation leading up to your death. This includes all knowledge of who killed your character, why your character was killed, and where your character was killed.
            •You cannot return to the RP scenario if you have re spawned.
            If you have been revived, you will keep your memory and disregard NLR. However, you must RP your injury for at least 15 minutes – this depends on the injury as well.
            • Minor Injuries (~15 mins) – Sprained ligaments, fractured/broken bones that would not require surgery??
            • Major injuries (~45 mins) – Fatal injuries, or anything that requires advanced life support (CPR, defib, monitoring, surgery). This includes gunshot wounds,
            If you are ICU’d, you can either lose all or part of your memory. This depends on how the severity of the injuries. There will be instances where your character should be dead, but instead of re spawning, you wait for a medic to use the ICU command – you will lose all your memory. Medics may RP all medical procedures for a coma, leading up to them using the ICU command – you can lose all or part of your memory, this is your choice.
            You may not physically affect a person’s character to the point of no return/force NLR – this will be considered as power-gaming. For example, using /me shoots in head or /me cuts head off. Each player is in control of their character’s death. This does not mean that if your character is shot multiple times, you can RP as if you have only received minor injuries – you must be realistic with /me interactions.
            •However, if this is mutually agreed prior to the RP scenario, then disregard.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>INJURY RP:</h2>
        <p>When you are revived, you are in medical custody until the medic clears you. You cannot immediately run after someone for revenge, you are injured for 15-30 minutes depending on the injuries. For example, if you are stabbed multiple times in the legs and you just got patched up, there is no way you can run normally.
            If you’ve done a stunt jump or have fallen off a great height, DO NOT IGNORE INJURY RP.
            When EMS are on duty, do not re spawn without permission. If you were killed in a way where you cannot be revived, please let the medics know in RP. For example, /me was shot in the head multiple times and has no pulse. This also applies to when you are killing off your character. A medic will arrive on scene and you will confirm your death with /me.
            Do not re spawn without permission during RP situations. Remember you are still in RP.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>LOGGING:</h2>
        <p>If you are in the middle of an RP scenario, do not log out. For example, if you’re downed, in the middle of combat, or being convicted, you cannot log.
            If your game crashes, please inform us in discord.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>COPS/EMS:</h2>
        <p>You cannot constantly target the cop/ems on duty.
            If they are the only cop on duty, you cannot kidnap or down the cop. (In Future)
            If you are the only cop on duty and you are downed, you cannot clear the scene or use your radio and the medics cannot respond.
            •HOWEVER, if a cop/ems put themselves in danger, these rules will be disregarded due to their own fault.
            No cop baiting. Do not purposefully try and get police attention on you by doing things you would not do with an officer near you. This includes, burning out in the middle of intersections, purposefully revving your motor at lights to bait a pull over/chase, purposely committing traffic violations in the vicinity of a police officer.
            Do not impersonate cop/ems. Do not use the character models that are associated with emergency services.
            An active on duty EMS cannot be threatened or kidnapped or gun pointed to revive your friends. Illegal EMS will be provided soon for the same.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>VALUE YOUR LIFE:</h2>
        <p>Follow FearRP: Fearing for your life. For example, if you are alone in an alleyway and 4 gang members hold you at gunpoint and you cannot escape without dying, you must follow FearRP. The average person would follow their demands as they are helpless in a situation of such, you would not just walk away.
            You must value your life and the lives of others. For example, do not attempt to draw a weapon while being held at gunpoint. You may not run at someone with a melee weapon if at gunpoint – you may only defend yourself at a realistic distance.
            You must value your life and the lives of others (not at the detriment of your own). If you have a gun out and someone attempts to hold you up from the FRONT, you do not have to surrender. If someone has a gun to your blind spot (to your back as an example) it does not matter if you have a weapon or not you must surrender within a realistic distance.
            If you have a gun to your head and you run away – this is a serious violation of this rule. You must comply to reasonable demands if your life is under threat – by weapons or numbers. There is a value of freedom – once physically attacked you have the right to defend yourself or run for safety. Furthermore, value of freedom should be considered when fleeing from robberies, however there is a reasonable point where value of life trumps value of freedom. IE. Multiple officers with guns pointed on you and positioned around a car you are trying to steal, if you drive away and don’t surrender. You are not valuing your life.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>DO NOT FAIL RP:</h2>
        <p>Due to the mechanics of GTA V, things that are completely unrealistic and downright impossible to do are easily done while in game. Think before you do, your actions should be thought out before you act. For example, driving off an overpass and dropping 20+ feet while in your vehicle, flipping the vehicle multiple times, then proceeding to continue driving off while being pursued by police will not be tolerated. Realistic actions and responses.
            Do not enter the military base. There is no feasible way you would be able to cross over the fences of an actual military base without either being detained or shot on the spot. Entering these areas will result in an immediate warning, repeating it multiple times will result in BAN.
            Entering the Mission Row PD detention area is prohibited, or the prison yard of Bolingbroke Penitentiary is considered Fail RP. There is no feasible way to walk yourself through these areas without permission. There would be too many cameras, locked areas requiring special access.
            Use of a phone or a gun in prison or when cuffed is considered FailRP. This includes texting and tweeting. We do not have player prison guards to RP yourself stealing a phone, so we are not aware of if it is RP’d out correctly, so do not do it. You also get searched and lose your belongings when sent to prison. Police are requested to confiscate radio and mobile phone of the users when being jailed.
            
            If you are using a 3rd party VOIP application, stop it when the active RP starts and use the Servers official VOIP.
            Stealing Police/EMS/Military Vehicles is NOT allowed, (Vehicles include helicopters, tanks, jets, transport vehicles, cargo-bobs, military helicopters, etc.) However, emergency service player vehicles can be stolen with proper RP behind it. This includes using specific /me interactions, as well as a reason to steal the vehicle. You must be in an active cop situation that involves you. For example, /me takes or steals key from officer. If you are confused on what is the wrong and right way to steal an emergency vehicle, use the help desk in discord.
            Do not go AFK for long periods of time. You will be kicked.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>BREAKING CHARACTER:</h2>
        <p>Stay in character unless spoken to by an admin or a moderator about ooc situation. There is no reason you should break character unless you are speaking to a staff member about a problem that needs to be resolved. These situations usually end up being handled in discord.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>PVP CRIMES:</h2>
        <p>If cops are offline, PVP crimes – such as robberies, murders, stealing vehicles from players, etc. are not allowed.
            • However, kidnapping and gang vs gang fights are allowed.
            You cannot demand an absurd amount of money when robbing a player. – You must be reasonable. For example, demanding $500k for a person is considered unreasonable.
            You cannot re spawn if you have committed crime and police are waiting for a med unit.
            Depending on the severity of your injuries, you will go to the hospital and be charged for the crimes you have committed, or you will be ICU’d. Either way, you will serve the time for your crime.
            You must be reasonable during hostage/ robbery. If you are unreasonable, note that police will breach and attack.
            Concealing your identity is allowed if you are wanted by the police, however, drastic changes to your face is not allowed. You may change the colour of your hair, use a mask, or remove your beard if you let an admin know.
            You must RP taking your weapons out, unless it is something small like a pistol or knife. IRL, it does not take you 2 seconds to take an AR out of your bag.
            Continued disregard for in game laws including traffic, felony and misdemeanour laws will not be tolerated. This does not mean that you cannot break laws, it just means that driving excessively fast everywhere you go, running every light at high speeds, starting fights for little to no RP reason or any other form of non-RP activity will not be tolerated.
            You cannot kidnap/rob the same player more than once within 24 hours unless RP is agreed upon. There must be a mutual agreement. Keep in mind, you can be interrupting their RP.
            If you feel you have been mistreated in a police situation, do not police the police. Use the proper channels (IE: Reporting said officer to a higher up). Do not contact an admin unless the officer is clearly breaking a server rule. Take abuse of power as in character and report it as you see fit.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>FORBIDDEN RP SCENARIOS:</h2>
        <p>Role playing sexual assault (such as non-consensual touching, rape, etc.) is not allowed and will result in an immediate ban. This also applies verbally. Do not joke or mock sexual harassment. We do not tolerate this behaviour and a ban appeal will not be allowed.
            •However, if this is mutually agreed prior to the RP scenario, then disregard.
            Suicide RP and Terrorism RP are not allowed. We understand that this happens IRL, but they are touchy subjects that people do not need to be reminded of. There are minimal exceptions, please contact an admin for permission before role playing suicide or terrorist acts.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>SERVER RESTARTS:</h2>
        <p>Just because the server is restarting does not mean that you can go insane and go on a rampage. Along with that, if you are leaving the server after your session, you have no reason to kill for no reason. There will be consequences for breaking rules, whether it is 5 hours from restart or 1 minute before.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>HOSTAGE RULES:</h2>
        <p>You may take hostages at the scene for robberies – but cheesing(cheating/fake) hostages (making job calls or abducting random people at central garage) for the sake of escaping from PD or a scenario is against the rules.
            The only exceptions to this are if a hostage scenario is providing story – meaning you are RPing out a full scenario with them and it is a part of a larger RP.
            There is a minimum 24-hour ban. Also, it is worth noting – if you are unreasonable with hostages the police WILL BREACH AND SHOOT YOU. They have an obligation at a certain point to save the hostages life when it feels like criminals are being unreasonable and that their life is in danger – if you try to leave with a hostage from a scene, you are likely to be met with force due to this.
            You are not allowed to bring a hostage to PD and demand ransom or release your friends. What is lost is lost, earn it back.
            Hostage must always follow Fear RP and cooperate, criminals must be reasonable with hostage. Breaking this will result in 24-hour ban.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>USE COMMON SENSE:</h2>
        <p>We ask you use common sense: If you are shot multiple times, fall off a building, or go down in an explosion then do not re-engage even if it has been 1 hour. RP serious injuries. Examples of what is NOT allowed: Re spawn and then immediately drive a car to pick up your wanted friend who you just attempted to rob the bank with EMS revives PD Officer who then immediately starts chasing the Criminal(s) who escaped a Robbery. We are not your headmaster or teacher to let you know what common sense is and what is nonsense.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>RMT & SCAM:</h2>
        <p>Real money trade is strictly prohibited for PR (Permanent residents) if found guilty it will lead to permanent ban and removal of ban will not be entertained
            Requesting players not to scam others in the city with the intention of scamming however the persons can do this as RP, if this is reported as OOC both the teams will be called upon for discussion and this might result in 1 week ban and might lead to permanent ban if repeated
            
            RMT Example: Selling any Medkits or limited edition cars or game cash etc for Real money</p>
